# My personal portflio!

## Technologies used:
- React and Link from react-scroll
- Styled with CSS
----
## How `{ Link } from "react-scroll"` was used:
- React scroll allows the user to scroll the specified element in the navigation bar.

----
## Struggles:
- I would have liked to used Bootstrap Cards for the project section of my portfolio, but I did not start my portfolio using bootstrap CSS so it would have took some time to rename all the classes that clash with the bootstrap classes.
